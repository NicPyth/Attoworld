## Guidelines
The goal of this module is to gather the python programming work that we do, which maybe others in the group or the community at large could benefit from, into a module that we can easily add to our projects. This is easier if we follow some guidelines for best practices:
 - Use docstrings so that people know how to use your functions.
 - Comment code enough that it's understandable. It's possible that you write in a "self documenting" way, which is fine, but if you're doing something fancy and non-obvious, put in a note
 - If there's a function or class that you think others could benefit from, absolutely feel free to add it to the main modules. If you think you are likely the only one who will use something, you can also add a submodule to the attoworld.personal namespace. This makes it easier to share files with others!
